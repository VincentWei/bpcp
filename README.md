# Samples for Best Practices of C

This repository contains the examples for my online video course:
[the Best Practices of C Language].

I use a fake project `FooBar` to show the good or bad code.

## Source Tree of FooBar

FooBar contains the skeleton of a typical C library project:

- The building system based on CMake.
- The headers and source files of the library.
- The unit test programs based on gtest.
- Some samples for the usage of the APIs.

The source tree of FooBar is illustrated as follow:

- `docs/`: The lecture slides of this course.
- `src/foobar/include/`: The global header files.
- `src/foobar/include/private`: The internal header files.
- `src/foobar/utils/`: Some basic and common utilities.
- `src/foobar/foo/`: The module of Foo.
- `src/foobar/bar/`: The module of Bar.
- `src/foobar/xxx/`: The module of XXX.
- `src/foobar/ports/`: The ports for different platforms,
    such as a POSIX-compliant systems or Windows.
- `src/foobar/bindings/`: The bindings for Python, Lua,
    and other programming languages.
- `src/wtf/`: The simplified WTF (Web Template Framework) from WebKit.
- `src/cmake/`: The cmake modules.
- `src/third-party/`: The third-party libraries, such as `gtest`.
- `src/test/`: The unit test programs.
- `tools/`: Some tools for easy development.
- `examples/`: The examples using the library.

## Current Status

This project was launched in Sept. 2021.

We welcome anybody to take part in the development and contribute your effort!

## Coding Style

We mainly follow [Linux Kernel Coding Style], with the following exceptions.

### Indentation

We always use four spaces for indentation.

### Printing messages

### Allocating memory

## Building

### Commands

To build the source on Linux:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DPORT=Linux
$ make
```

To build the source on macOS:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DPORT=Mac
$ make
```
